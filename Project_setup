🚀 GitHub-to-S3 Automated Sync
This project automates the deployment of static websites. By connecting GitHub to AWS CodePipeline, every git push triggers an automated deployment to an S3 bucket configured for static hosting.

🏗 Architecture Overview
Source: Developer pushes code to the main branch on GitHub.

Trigger: AWS CodeStar Connection detects the change.

Deploy: CodePipeline fetches the code and extracts it directly into the S3 bucket.

Live: The website is immediately updated and accessible via the S3 endpoint.

📋 Prerequisites
An AWS Account with administrative privileges.

A GitHub Repository containing your web assets (e.g., index.html, style.css).

🛠 Phase 1: Prepare the S3 Destination
1. Create the Bucket
Open the S3 Console.

Create a bucket with a unique name (e.g., my-github-website-2026).

2. Configure Settings
Public Access: Uncheck Block all public access and acknowledge the warning.

Static Hosting: * Navigate to Properties -> Static website hosting.

Select Enable.

Set index.html as the Index document.

3. Apply Bucket Policy
Copy this JSON into Permissions -> Bucket Policy. Replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with your actual bucket name:

JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
🔗 Phase 2: Create the Pipeline
1. Pipeline Settings
Pipeline Name: GitHub-to-S3-Sync.

Service Role: Select New service role.

2. Source Stage (GitHub)
Provider: GitHub (Version 2).

Connection: Follow the prompts to Connect to GitHub and authorize AWS.

Repository & Branch: Select your target repo and the main branch.

3. Build Stage
Click Skip build stage.

Note: Only required for frameworks requiring compilation (React, Vue, etc.).

4. Deploy Stage
Provider: Amazon S3.

Bucket: Select your website bucket.

Deployment Options: IMPORTANT: Check the box Extract file before deploying.

⚠️ Troubleshooting
403 Forbidden: Ensure the S3 Bucket Policy was saved correctly and "Block all public access" is turned OFF.

Files not updating: Check the CodePipeline Console to ensure the latest "Source" step succeeded.

Zip file in S3: If you see a .zip file in your bucket instead of your code, you forgot to check Extract file before deploying in the Deploy stage.

✅ Final Result
Once the pipeline shows a green Succeeded status, find your URL in the S3 Properties tab under Static website hosting.
